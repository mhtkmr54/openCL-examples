This code has been created using the AMDAPPSDK sample "FluidSimulation2D" as a refernce.
It uses the Lattice-Boltzmann Method in D2Q9 (2 dimensions, 9 velocity directions).
Simulation using OpenGL is yet to be added.
Float values have been used as my GPU does not support double precision.
The simulation will take place for 100 units of time
